# MERN-event-manager
A simple event manager application I made back in mid 2023. It consists of backend server using Node and Express frameworks that communicate with MongoDB Atlas cluster. Frontend was created using React.js framework.
### Project description
An application for managing user's events. Events contain information about event name, description, place, start and end dates and type of event: home or business. Users can add, modify and delete their events. Users can create an account and log in. After logging in, users can also see their account details and delete their account with all associated data. Application and code comments are in Polish.
### Installation
1. Add your MongoDB cluster connection link in _.env_ file
2. Start server using _npm start_ command. Server will start on port 8080.
3. Start client application using _npm start_ command. Application will start on port 3000.
